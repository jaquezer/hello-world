# hello-world

Hello everyone, my name is Jaquez and I am so very new and green to all this in regards to everything described about computers, software, hardware, and all the different languages used to code.  

I have tried codeacademy and other free teaching sites and I am just trying to be a self taught, self made man who can use my new skills to find a job and be part of tomorrow.  Thanks for stopping by and reading my bio!
